# Task 2

Create a single page website using `NextJS` that displays a countdown timer.

Requirements:

- Create a reusable component for the countdown timer. The component should take a datetime as a prop and display the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Accept user input to set the datetime to countdown and a `start` button to trigger the countdown.
